## [Unreleased]
### Added

### Changed
- Enforce HTTPS on HTTPS connectors

### Removed

## [3.2.0] - 2020-02-12
### Added
- Added macro `request_parser_joiner` to easily create a composite RequestParser that will match a request against multiple RequestParsersa
- Add DropContextService as a client middleware too
### Changed
- Make context macros self-contained
- Update swagger-rs to Rust 2018 Edition

## [3.1.0] - 2019-05-07
### Added
- Add `swagger::client::MakeService` trait

## [3.0.0] - 2019-03-08
### Changed
- Hyper 0.12 support.

  This creates large scale changes with corresponding renaming (e.g. `NewService` -> `MakeService`) and other fall out.

  Hyper Services don't have Request as a type parameters -  instead the body of the request / response are type parameters.

  As such context for requests, such as authorization data is kept in a `ContextualPayload` struct, instead of a tuple.

### Removed
- `AddContext` structs which we were previously deprecated are now removed.

## [2.0.2] - 2018-12-13
### Added
- Allow ContextWrapper to be cloned.

## [2.0.1] - 2018-11-12
### Changed
* Make compatible with clippy on stable (1.30.1)

## [2.0.0] - 2018-09-28

### Changed
- Added the `AddContextNewService` and `AddContextService` structs, and deprecated the old `AddContext` struct. One or other of the new structs should be a drop-in replacement for the `AddContext`, depending on whether it was being used as a `NewService` or `Service`.
- modified the `new_context_type` macro to only implement `Push`, `Pop` and `Has` for types explicitly passed to the macro. This is a breaking change, which should only require minor changes such as adding type annotations if the macro was used as recommended in the docs.

## [1.0.2] - 2018-07-23
### Added
- Added (non-HTTPS) support for Windows/MacOS/iOS

## [1.0.1] - 2018-05-24
### Added
- `SwaggerService` trait used by swagger-codegen middlewares.

## [1.0.0] - 2018-04-30
No changes. We now think we've got enough to declare this crate stable.

## [0.12.1] - 2018-04-27
### Added
- `RequestParser` trait for retrieving Swagger related info in middlewares.

### Changed
- Fixed `DropContext` to remove trait bounds on the type of context it can drop

## [0.12.0] - 2018-04-26
### Added
- `DropContext` to pass a raw (context-less) `hyper::Request` to a service.

## [0.11.0] - 2018-04-11
### Added
- `Has<T>`, `Pop<T>` and `Push<T>` traits for specifying requirements on context types in hyper services, and providing methods for manipulating them
- `new_context_type!` macro for defining structs that can be used to build concrete context types that implement `Has`, `Pop` and `Push`
- `make_context!` and `make_context_ty!` for conveniently creating contexts at value and type level

### Removed
- Old `Context` struct

### Changed
- Renamed `NoAuthentication` to `MiddlewareWrapper` and moved it to its own module.

## [0.10.0] - 2018-03-16
### Added
- Structs for combining multiple hyper services

## [0.9.0] - 2018-01-25
### Added
- Connector functions for instantiating easy-mode clients
- The ability to pass in a `slog::Logger` with Context

## [0.8.1] - 2017-12-20
### Changed
- Fix build error and clippy warning.

## [0.8.0] - 2017-12-15
### Added
- Asynchronous HTTP client/server support

### Removed
- Synchronous HTTP client/server support - if you're still using synchronous swagger-codegen, stay at 0.7.0

### Changed
- `AllowAllMiddleware` (an Iron middleware) has been replaced by `AllowAllAuthenticator` (a Hyper Service wrapper)

## [0.7.0] - 2017-10-02
### Added
- `ContextWrapper` - wraps an `Api` with a `Context`

## [0.6.0] - 2017-09-25
### Changed
- Authorization struct now has new field `issuer`.

## [0.5.0] - 2017-09-18
- Start of changelog.
